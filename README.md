# E-Commerce Data Analysis 

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on an e-commerce website. The analysis uses two CSV files as data sources, and the final visualizations and insights are presented in a Power BI report (.pbix file).

## Project Overview

This project analyzes key metrics from e-commerce data to provide insights into customer behavior, order trends, and product performance. Using Power BI, we created dashboards and visuals to showcase these findings in a user-friendly way.

## Contents

- **Data Files:**  
  - `Orders.csv` – Contains transactional data, including order ID, product details, order date, quantity, and sales amount.
  - `Details.csv` – Contains customer-related data, such as customer ID, demographic details, and account information.

- **Power BI Report:**  
  - `E-Commerce-Analysis.pbix` – A Power BI report that combines data from both CSV files to provide insights through interactive visualizations.

## Key Visualizations and Insights

The Power BI report covers:
- **Sales Overview:**  
  - Total sales, revenue trends by month, and average order value.
  - Identification of top-performing products and seasonal trends.

- **Customer Analysis:**  
  - Breakdown of customer demographics, such as age and location.
  - Insights on purchase frequency and customer segments.

- **Order Trends:**  
  - Analysis of peak order times, fulfillment status, and shipping methods.
  - Trends in order quantities and repeat purchases.

## Data Sources and Transformation

- The **Orders.csv** file was cleaned to remove any null values and formatted to capture key metrics such as revenue and product count.
- The **Details.csv** file was transformed to match customer IDs with order data, enabling cross-analysis of customer demographics and order history.
